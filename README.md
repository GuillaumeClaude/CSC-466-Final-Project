### Packet Laundering on Tor Network

The Tor network is a peer to peer networking service which anonymizes user traffic using [Onion Routing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion_routing). User traffic is generally not traceable to a particular IP address unless an End to End confirmation attack is used. This attack involves long term traffic analysis at both entry and exit of the Tor network. [Paper Describing](https://www.ohmygodel.com/publications/usersrouted-ccs13.pdf) how it works. 

We are Guillaume Claude and Chase Churla and our project is based on developing methods to defend from End to End confirmation attacks.
